# 💡 System Comparison

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="existing" label="Existing System" default>

Many existing digital learning platforms are either:
- Too technical for beginners  
- Unorganized or overloaded with content  
- Not available in regional languages  
- Built for students, not everyday users like elders or rural learners  
- Lacking video-based, step-by-step tutorials  
- Not mobile-friendly or accessible for the visually impaired  
- Don’t support offline or low-network users  

In short, they often assume a baseline digital literacy — which most of our audience doesn’t have.
